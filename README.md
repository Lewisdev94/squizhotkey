# SquizzyCuts

a chrome extension to make squiz a little better with shortcuts

## What to do

- Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/

- Enable Developer Mode (top right maybe?)

- Use Load unpacked and open the folder that contains the background.js and manifest.json

## The commands

- Shift+Alt+A for / \_admin

- Shift+Alt+R for / \_recache

- Shift+Alt+N for / \_nocache

## Use at your own risk, you might start to really like Squiz

if the loader gets angry about commands, then you might need to adjust the key combination as it's taken by something else.
